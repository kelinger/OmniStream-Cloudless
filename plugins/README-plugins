OmniStream supports a limited set of plugins that, if they exist, will be called
before or after specific processes.  These can be any executable (be sure to define
the language with a header like #!/bin/bash).

	up-start
	up-end
	down-start
	down-end
	sync-start
	sync-end
	backup-start
	backup-end
	update-start
	update-end

These run at the beginning or end of the up, down, sync, backup, or update processes.
Your custom scripts will not be replaced or removed when OmniStream is updated.
